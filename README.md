# Stopwatch for KOReader

A [koreader][1] plugin to display a stopwatch in a fullscreen widget.
A clean, fullscreen, perfectly centered stopwatch with Pause / Resume and Restart buttons.

## Motivation

I sometimes need a big clock or stopwatch, so why not use my ereader?

Works on every KOReader device (Kobo, Kobo, PocketBook, Android, Linux…).

## Installation

Clone and copy this repository to the `koreader/plugins` folder.

## Usage

Navigate to `Plugins -> More tools -> Stopwatch` to open the widget. Tap
anywhere on the screen to close the widget. Use the buttons to pause/resume or restart.

## Testing

Tested with Koreader 2025.08 on a Kobo Clara 2E and linux.
